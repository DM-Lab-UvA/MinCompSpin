# MinCompSpin

MinCompSpin is a C++ library with Python bindings for analyzing discrete datasets using Minimally Complex Models (MCMs).
MCMs are a family of spinmodels that have minimal information-theoretic complexity.
The analysis using MCMs can uncover community structures in the data while taking into account possible higher-order interactions between the variables.
At the moment, datasets with up to 128 variables can be used for analysis.
